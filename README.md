# Scheduler application

The scheduler is designed to plan, create, monitor and reschedule schedules. The program is intended for the head of the TECHIN educational 
institution, who compiles lecture schedules. Using the schedule creation program, the process of creating schedules becomes more efficient and faster.

## :computer: Program management
Before you can start creating the schedule, you first need to enter the data for the classes, modules and shifts. With this data, it is possible 
to create the subjects to which the modules and classes are assigned. Then teachers are added, for which it is necessary to select the teacher 
shifts and the subjects to be taught. Similarly, programmes are added, which require the addition of subjects. Groups can then be created, to which 
the required shifts and programmes are assigned. With all the data listed above, the creation of the timetable can begin.
